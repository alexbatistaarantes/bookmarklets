[Search](./search_book.js) for a book in multiple online libraries (ðŸ¦œðŸ‘€) at once

When you're in a page for a book in Amazon or Goodreads, or with the book title highlighted, click on the bookmarklet and new tabs will open searching the book by title and author name in online libraries in new tabs

To add a library, just search something in it, and in the URL created in the result, replace the thing you searched for with an `%s`, and place this in the `libraries_urls` variable

Example:
```
window.libraries_urls = [
    "https://ðŸ¦œðŸ‘€library.com/search?query=%s",
];
```
